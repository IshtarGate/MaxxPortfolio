            <h1>Ex Neuroscientist, Reincarnated Developer</h1>
            <h3>tl:dr</h3>
            <p>I didn't think I was really helping anyone with my research, and computer science is too cool to not be a part of.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>The Long Story</h3>
            <p>I've always been a nerd. As long as I can remember. I've always loved science and technology. I went to community college not knowing exactly what I wanted to study but I just knew I wanted to learn more about everything. I studied Physics and Math. So when it came time to transfer to JMU, Biotechnology seemed like an absolute no brainer. The ability to bend bacteria to our will to produce insulin and myriad other biological molecules and drugs was just too cool to pass up. I took Organic Chemistry and worked in a protein purification lab. I loved it. I thought I loved doing science. So I thought I wanted to do research. I was going to take the world by storm and make great strides to help humanity. It was here that I broke. I was ecstatic to get into the University of Virginia Graduate Bioscience Program. I even managed to change departments to Neuroscience and work for 3 years in an Epilepsy Lab. I was going to study the brain and answer the most important questions of how we think and what consciousness is made of. Sadly I learned that I really wasn't helping anyone. My project wasn't working, I wasn't allowed to take it by the reigns. I resigned myself to following my adviser's recommendations and generally felt pretty defeated. I didn't feel useful or of any value. I wanted to have skills that were wanted. Over my time there I started learning Matlab. My beautiful savior of a language. I had always thought that programming and computers were cool. I loved tinkering. I had even built gaming computers and had set up a file server for the lab, but I always felt like programming was something akin to being a movie or rock star, just something that the lucky few attain. It wasn't until a friend of my from my first lab at JMU told me his story of turning his life around, turning away from medschool and pursuing programming, that I realized that I could do it to. It was a breath of fresh air. I felt freedom unlike I had felt in a long time. I consulted my thesis committee about leaving science, I told my adviser I wanted to go, but I fell prey to their honeyed words in my ear, "you can finish quickly and still get the Ph.D.", so I waited another year. Now a year's past. I've kept my word and I've physically left UVA for a software development apprenticeship at Maxx Potential. I feel great knowing I'm moving closer to my goal. </p>
